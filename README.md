# Disengaged

Do you want a healthier internet?

An Engagement Blocker blocks dark-patterns used by website designers to keep you on their site longer than you wanted. Disengaged is an Engagement Blocker.

By using this software to disable the predatory parts of the internet you not only make it a better place for yourself, you send a message to website designers that these sorts of patterns shouldn't be used in the first place.
