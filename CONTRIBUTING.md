Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the world's first Engagement Blocker!

Disengaged is opinionated software. Instead of having a settings page to let users configure behavior, the decisions are already made for them according to a code of ethics.

All contributions must uphold the code of ethics.

Luckily, the code of ethics is growth-oriented just like the rest of the codebase, so contributions are welcome for it as well.

Think of this repo as two projects in symbiosis. It's a browser plugin to remove engagement dark-patterns; and it's a set of guidelines for sites that wish to proactively avoid engagement dark-patterns on their own.

## I want to fix a bug

_Rolls out the red carpet_

Thank you! Due to the nature of content scripts, this repo require steady maintenance. It's a community effort to keep everything working.

These efforts are what allow people to continue using the plugin and providing their personal experiences and wisdom toward future improvements.

In short, fixing bugs in this repo is like working in the engine room for a better internet.

## I want to add or modify a site

All new scripts must be written to uphold an existing guideline in the code of ethics. The top of the file should specify which guideline it addresses. Follow the format of existing scripts.

If the script you want to make is not covered by the code of ethics, you'll have to first improve the code of ethics.

## I want to improve the code of ethics

Open an issue, start it with `[RFC]` and explain your reasoning.

The most common way to start is with a concrete use case demonstrating what you want to block or unblock, and which is currently incompatible or not covered by the code of ethics.
